Fireworks Simulator
Introduction:
As a player/user of this interface you must choose the following parameters for a projectile:

1.)	Fuse Time: The time in fact has been converted as a fraction of
 the time of flight for your convenience. If you drag the slider all the
 way to the right, then the firework goes off at the maximum height at 
that angle and velocity.
2.)	Velocity: You can choose between from 50 to 100 pixels per 
second. 
3.)	Angle: This slider gives you the option of choosing an angle 
from 0 to 90 degrees
4.)	Color: This facility is again provided by Combo Box.
5.)	Pattern: gives you cool blast options to choose from. 
Once you set all these parameters you can choose to launch one firework 
or two by clicking the launch or launch 2 Button. The fireworks path(a 
parabola like that of a projectile) will be printed on the screen and 
the timer will determine the x and y coordinates on which the explosion
 happens. At these coordinates the explosion (of the pattern of your 
choice) will be printed. 
You can always change the parameters and the changes will be reflected 
on the Canvas.
